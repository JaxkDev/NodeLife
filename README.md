# NodeLife
A small text based game made in pure python,
users who have python3.4+ can run the source code, those who do not can use our pre-built packages to run it.

However we only support a range of Operating Systems:
- MacOS/Darwin (Excluding IOS) 10.X+
- Windows 10.X
- Linux

please not that if you do run the source on other O.S’s we hold no responsibility and will not help you with any issues found or caused.

# Overview
The game should never be run in sudo/admin mode as no operations are made to any protected folders/files.

A internet connection is recommended to check for updates and install them, but it is not required to have a connection.
This may change without notice.

The game does attempt to set console title, use colour on output and log everything
Logs can be found in the directory(/data/logs) created wherever the executable/source code is held.
All data created stored and downloaded are stored in (/data)

The game does use multi-threading for smoother experience this may cause a bit of lagg, soon a option will be available to disable multi-threading.
Also note that we do use ‘slow text’ to provide a realistic experience this means that instead of writing the whole sentance in half a second each character is written to the screen one at a time, this can cause lagg in when you recieve the text (Linux and Mac users have this disabled for now)
this too is planned to have a disable/enable option.

The game uses your logged in username as a default and this may be changable in the future but not currently, no other personnal information is stored
In the future the game will get and use you Device UUID for securing resuests to our servers we do not give out any information given to any 3rd party org’s
